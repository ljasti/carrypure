Over the years, I have researched the potential of sugarcane bagasse as a valuable raw material not only for tableware but also for durable and environmentally responsible construction products. This passion for sustainable engineering aligns perfectly with CarryPure's vision of turning agricultural byproducts into practical, high-quality products that reduce environmental impact. At CarryPure LLP, I contribute to product development, quality control, and strategic planning, ensuring that our biodegradable sugarcane bagasse tableware meets rigorous standards while exploring opportunities for future innovations in allied industries. My engineering mindset helps bridge the gap between material science, manufacturing processes, and market needs. I believe that responsible resource utilization is key to a greener future, and through my role at CarryPure, I aim to drive innovation that benefits both the environment and society.</p>

While I have dedicated much of my life to managing my household and supporting my family, I am now channeling my organizational skills, commitment to quality, and passion for sustainability into building a business that addresses one of today's most pressing needs — reducing single-use plastic waste. CarryPure LLP is committed to producing durable, safe, and compostable tableware made from sugarcane bagasse, a natural byproduct of sugarcane processing. Our products are designed to serve homes, businesses, and events that value health, convenience, and environmental responsibility. As Managing Director, I am responsible for shaping the company's vision, overseeing operations, and developing partnerships that will help CarryPure grow into a recognized name in sustainable products. My journey from homemaker to entrepreneur reflects the belief that it's never too late to start something meaningful — and that care for the planet starts with the choices we make every day. Our mission is simple: offer customers eco-friendly alternatives that don't compromise on quality, while contributing to a cleaner, greener future for the generations to come.</p>
